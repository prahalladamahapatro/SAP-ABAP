# **1. DATA DICTIONARY**

### **Easy**

1. What is a Data Dictionary in SAP ABAP?
ANS : Data Dictionary is a central repository in SAP where we define and manage metadata objects such as tables, views, structures, data elements, domains, search helps, lock objects, and 	more. It controls how data is stored, structured, and accessed at the database level.

2. What is the difference between a table, a structure, and a view?
ANS: 	In SAP, a database table is a physical data container. It stores data permanently in rows and columns and supports full CRUD operations.
	A structure is a blueprint that defines fields but does not store any data. It is used only for data formatting and temporary storage in programs.
	A view is a virtual combination of fields from one or more tables. It does not store data; during runtime, it only reads data from underlying tables.

3. What are domains and data elements?
ANS:	In SAP, a domain defines the technical attributes of a field — the data type, length, and allowed value range or value table.
	A data element defines the semantic attributes — the field’s meaning, description, and labels used in programs, screens,

4. What is a foreign key relationship?
ANS:	A foreign key is a field (or set of fields) in a child table that refers to the primary key of a parent table. It links the tables and ensures referential integrity — meaning only 	valid, existing values from the parent table can be entered in the child table. This relationship helps maintain data consistency across tables.

5. What is a search help?
ANS:	In SAP, a Search Help (F4 help) is used to display possible input values to the user and return selected values back to the input field. 
	SAP provides two types of search helps:
	1. Elementary Search Help → Defines a single search path based on one table, view, or custom search method.
	2. Collective Search Help → Groups multiple elementary search helps together and lets the user choose among different search paths.


### **Medium**

6. Explain the difference between a database view, projection view, and help view.
ANS: 	A database view is a virtual view created using joins on one or more database tables.
	A projection view is defined on a single table and exposes only selected fields. It is used to restrict field-level access.
	A maintenance view allows updating multiple related tables together through a TMG (SM30). It is used for CRUD operations on tables having foreign-key relationships.
	A help view is used by search helps to read data from multiple tables and provide value help to the user.

7. What is a lock object and why is it used?
ANS:	Lock objects are used in SAP to synchronize access to shared data and prevent data inconsistency. When multiple users attempt to change the same record, the lock object ensures 	only one user can update it at a time.
	In SAP, lock objects (beginning with ‘E’) generate two function modules — ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE — which apply and release application-level locks. Lock objects use SAP’s enqueue 	server and support different lock modes such as exclusive and shared locks.

8. What is buffering? Explain buffering types.
ANS: 	Buffering is the mechanism where SAP stores table records in the application server to reduce database hits and improve performance. When a buffered table is read multiple times, 	the system retrieves data from memory instead of the database.
	SAP supports three types of buffering:
	1. Single-record buffering – Only individual records are buffered based on key access.
	2. Generic buffering – Records are buffered based on a part of the key (generic key prefix).
	3. Full buffering – The entire table is buffered in the application server.
	Buffering can be applied only on transparent tables.

9. What is the use of table maintenance generator (SM30)?
ANS: 	TMG is used to generate maintenance dialogs for transparent tables so that users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through a SM30.
	It works only for tables that have a proper primary key and are allowed for maintenance.
